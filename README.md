# Learning Go

gbex/ contains things I copied from gobyexample.com to try them.

In adventofcode19, I'm solving the problems from
<https://adventofcode.com/2019>.  I started with problem 6 because I had
already done up through problem 5 with Ruby, but I had to go back to redo 2 and
5 to get the "Intcode" computer up and running.
